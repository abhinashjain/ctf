## Task:
Determine the random number generated by random.getrandbits(32)

## Bug:
* random.getrandbits(32) is based upon Mersenne Twister that is not designed to be cryptographycally secure.

## Solution:
* Python's randcrack module is used to predict the next random number.
* From option 2 in dice_roll.py generate 624 random numbers and submit them to randcrack.
* From 625th number onwards there's good probability that randcrack will generate a same random number as generated in server.
* Take this 625th number and pass it in option 3 in dice_roll.py

[Randcrack](https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker) takes 624 32-bit random numbers and predicts the internal state matrix of the PRNG and outputs the most probable random numbers that might generate next. 
Accuracy of randcrack declines as more numbers are generated or predicted.
